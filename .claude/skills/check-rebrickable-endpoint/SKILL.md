# Verifying a Rebrickable API endpoint

`https://rebrickable.com/api/v3/swagger/?format=openapi` lists every path but **omits response
schemas and most form-body parameter details** (confirmed by inspection — paths show
`"responses": {"200": {"description": ""}}` with nothing else). Do not implement against it
blind; it will tell you an endpoint exists without telling you what it actually needs or
returns, and that gap has already caused at least two real bugs in this codebase (a decode
failure from an unexpectedly-nested response, and a silently-ignored `list_id` parameter that
doesn't exist on the endpoint being called).

## Get the real shape

Cross-check against the community-maintained spec, which has fuller (though still not 100%
complete) parameter documentation, pulled from the same backend:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/rienafairefr/pyrebrickable.git /tmp/pyrebrickable_check
grep -n '"/api/v3/users/{user_token}/YOUR_PATH' /tmp/pyrebrickable_check/rebrickable.json
# then read the surrounding ~100 lines for that path's parameters/description
sed -n '<line>,<line+100>p' /tmp/pyrebrickable_check/rebrickable.json
```

Read the `description` field carefully — it's prose, not structured, but it's often the *only*
place that mentions things like "list_id and include_spares may not be accurate unless the set
only exists in a single Set List" or nested response shapes.

If that still doesn't answer it (e.g. you need actual field names in a 200 response body, which
neither spec documents structurally), use WebSearch for the endpoint path plus a couple of
expected field names in quotes — third-party API client READMEs and forum posts have leaked the
real shape for most of the collection-management endpoints already.

## Before writing code against what you found

- If the endpoint is a path like `/users/{user_token}/setlists/{list_id}/sets/{set_num}/`,
  note that `list_id` is a **path** parameter there — a sibling endpoint at
  `/users/{user_token}/sets/{set_num}/` (no list_id in the path) will NOT let you target a
  specific list via a body/form parameter of the same name. Check which path you're actually
  calling.
- If a response nests data under a named key (Rebrickable does this for sets returned alongside
  collection metadata — see `UserSet` in `APIModels.swift` for the precedent), get the *exact*
  key name and structure before writing the `Codable` model — guessing field names here is what
  caused the original bug.
- If you genuinely cannot pin down a write endpoint's response shape (e.g.
  `POST /users/{user_token}/setlists/{list_id}/sets/` has an inconsistent/undocumented success
  body even after checking both specs), and the caller doesn't need any field from it, don't
  decode it — use `NetworkClient.post(path:formBody:)` (the non-generic overload; checks HTTP
  status only) and re-fetch real state through a read endpoint you *have* verified. This is what
  `addSetToList`/`moveSetToList` do now, after strict decoding caused a production bug where the
  add succeeded server-side but the UI showed a decoding error.
- There's no test target in this project (removed deliberately, see `AGENTS.md`) — verify a
  successful decode of the real shape manually instead (skill `verify`/`run`), since the
  nested-`UserSet` bug existed for a long time because nobody had actually exercised a real 200
  response against the decoder.

## Don't assume API capabilities that "should" exist

Rebrickable's `setlists` endpoints are lists of sets you **own** — there is no API support for
generic custom/wishlist lists independent of ownership. This was discovered by manually
reviewing the live API/site, not by reading docs more carefully; a wishlist feature was built on
top of the wrong assumption and had to be reverted. Before building a feature on an endpoint's
*implied* semantics, verify what it actually represents (read the full `description` field; if
still unclear, ask the user to confirm against the live site/API) rather than inferring it from
the path name alone.
